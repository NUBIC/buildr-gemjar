    <shortdesc>Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and tools.</shortdesc>
    <description>We wanted something that's simple and intuitive to use, so we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.  But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with a language that's a joy to use.</description>

        <created>2013-02-17</created>
        <revision>1.4.10</revision>
        <dc:description>
* Added:  Support a single intermediate directory for each project hierarchy
          through an addon 'buildr/single_intermediate_layout'.
* Fixed:  BUILDR-660 possible build issue when using build.yaml and tasks/*.rake
          (FÃ©lix Enrique Llorente Pastora)
* Added:  Support the :dir option in the Java::Commands.java method.
* Fixed:  Scala 2.10 support - compiler now uses additional/separate jars
          introduced in 2.10 such as scala-reflect.jar and scala-actor.jar
* Added:  Add an addon for NSIS.
* Change: BUILDR-612 - Support the TestNG 6.x versions and default
          to 6.8.
* Added:  BUILDR-599 - Support the passing of arguments to testng
          test runner.
* Fixed:  Observer the per-project source version when generating
          IDEA module files.
* Change: Sort the components in IDEA project files in the same
          order the idea sorts them.
* Fixed:  Findbugs addon correctly handles String dependencies
          (vs task dependencies)
* Fixed:  Checkstyle addon correctly handles String dependencies
          (vs task dependencies)
* Added:  Created an addon 'buildr/wsgen' for generating wsdls from java
          and java from wsdls using the underlying wsgen tool.
* Change: Defer the expansion of generated poms by wrapping the generation
          in a Proc.
* Change: Rework Artifact.content(value) method to accept a Proc that
          will be called before the artifact is written rather than
          requiring a string.
* Added:  Create a 'buildr/gpg' addon that signs and uploads signatures
          when uploading artifacts. Inspired by a similar extension in
          the Apache ODE project by Tammo van Lessen.
* Change: Updated dependency versions;
          - jruby-openssl (0.8.2)
          - atoulme-Antwrap (0.7.4)
* Change: Require 'bundler/setup' as part of buildr startup to ensure that
          buildr always runs with up to date dependencies if a Gemfile is
          present.
* Added:  Add FrameworkDetectionExcludesConfiguration facet to Idea project
          file creation by default.
* Fixed:  In the IntelliJ extension, defer the materialization of the
          default_components until expansion time to avoid loss of sub-
          components added after an add_component call.
* Fixed:  BUILDR-633 - Remove hardcoded shebang lines in all-in-one release.
* Added:  Create a simple extension that modifies the project layout to place
          generated files at the top level.

        <dc:description>
* Fixed:  Fixed the interaction with the FileUtils classes. The last release
          introduced a non-deterministic bug that sometimes caused logging
          preferences to be ignored and the install method to be
          inadvertently overwritten.
